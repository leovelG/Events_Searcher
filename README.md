# Events_Searcher
Have you ever wonder what you're gonna do this weekend or maybe you don't know what is happening right now at your city, well I may have a solution. 

This is a webscrapping project to create a database of events on different cities in Mexico, as of today it uses the following event webpages:
1. tusboletosMX
2. boletia.com

The idea is to use all the available data to create an interactive Dash that's easy to use and helpful to find all the events available your city. 
This is an scalable project, in future we want to know wich events our users found interesting and wich ones they liked the most so we can start making some models.
